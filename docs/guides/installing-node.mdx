## **Node vs NVM**

after this only the nvm manager is installed note that we still have to download node

run node -v to confirm if you have node on your computer

it should say node: command not found

the differents between nvm and node is that the nvm allows people to install any version of node with just one command. you can switch between different versions of node without uninstalling node from your computer 



## **Troubleshooting NVM installation**

Trying to EACCES permission denied with npm - how to fix: Always install node with a NVM and not through the package zip file because you may or may not have issues finding the profile in your thing...

if you are getting errors you have to make sure to always restart your terminal after installing new packages and commands.

If you still have problems after closing and opening your terminal, make sure you have the correct environment profiles in your home folder. If they don't exist the script will have nowhere to deposit the program and fail.
