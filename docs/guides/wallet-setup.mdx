    ![img](https://github.com/public-assembly/public-assembly-docs/blob/main/static/imgs/wallet-setup-assets/metamask/07.png)

    Your *12 Word* **Secret Backup Phrase** backs up your account.
    
        Without this phrase, you can't restore your MetaMask account or login into it on another device.
        Consider storing these words in a password manager, or downloading a file containing the phrase to a secure external disk.
    

    *(Do not store this on your desktop.  If someone steals, hacks, or finds your computer, they may access your MetaMask wallet.)*
    
    ![img](https://github.com/public-assembly/public-assembly-docs/blob/main/static/imgs/wallet-setup-assets/metamask/09.png)

    **Confirm** your **Secret Backup Phrase** to ensure you have it correct when asked.
    
    *This ensures you have the right phrase for account restoration*
    
    **Click** "Done" after verifying your **Secret Backup Phrase**.
