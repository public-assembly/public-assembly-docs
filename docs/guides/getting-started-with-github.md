## Forking and using templates

Below you will see an example of how to copy a repository to your own profile to be able to work on top of others work.

assemble package is a public assembly template that empowers developers to be able to make their own modular plug ins and packages for dApp development.

By clicking use this template you can make your own NPM package

![Use Template](https://github.com/public-assembly/public-assembly-docs/blob/main/static/imgs/getting-started-with-github-assets/12.png)

![Fork](https://github.com/public-assembly/public-assembly-docs/blob/main/static/imgs/getting-started-with-github-assets/13.png)


You'll be directed to a clone of the assemble-package template with al of the same files, now with your name in the header and ready to export to your local code editor.
